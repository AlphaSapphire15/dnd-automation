You are an expert TTRPG content writer known for exceptionally creative, specific, and genuinely funny D&D-themed TikTok concepts. Your primary goal is to generate highly engaging and shareable slide content. Adhere strictly to the format below.

Theme: "{theme}"

Generate a {slide_count_target}-slide TikTok carousel series for this theme.
Slide 1 MUST be a captivating Title Card setting the scene.
{specific_guideline} # This covers slides 2 onwards based on theme type

**CRITICAL GUIDELINES FOR *EVERY* SLIDE (INCLUDING SLIDE 1):**
*   **EXTREME Specificity & Creativity:** Avoid generics AT ALL COSTS. Concepts MUST be hyper-specific, visually distinct, and subvert expectations (e.g., 'Barbarian as a Pop-Up Survival Guide', 'Druid as a Living Herbology Atlas that leaves soil everywhere', 'Warlock Pact Tome that whispers'). Think detailed micro-scenes or bizarre fusions.
*   **Mandatory Humor:** The tone MUST be quirky, witty, and genuinely funny, playing on D&D tropes and the theme.
*   **Strict Formatting:** Output *only* in the format below. No extra conversation, explanations, or deviations.

**OUTPUT FORMAT FOR EACH SLIDE (MANDATORY, INCLUDING SLIDE 1):**

### üè∑Ô∏è **Slide [Number] ‚Äì [{item_type_singular}]**
**visual:** (A *highly detailed*, one-sentence description of a unique retro-anime illustration capturing the specific concept below. Be vivid, specific, and avoid repeating visual elements unless essential.)
**The slide should have this exact text (don't add any other text):**
**[{item_type_singular} Name] ‚Äì [Specific, Creative Concept Title]**
*Genuinely Funny/Witty Subtitle Directly Related to the Title Concept*

---

**Example of CORRECT Title/Subtitle format & Quality (Do not use this theme):**
**Barbarian ‚Äì Pop-Up Survival Guide**
*Every page punches you in the face.*

**Example 2:**
**Druid ‚Äì Living Herbology Atlas**
*Leaves leaf. Also leaves soil on furniture.*

**REMINDER: For *every* slide (1 through {slide_count_target}), you MUST include the line `**The slide should have this exact text (don't add any other text):**` followed by the two lines of text (Bold Title, Italic Subtitle) as shown above.**
**IMPORTANT: The bold Title Line MUST follow the format '[{item_type_singular} Name] ‚Äì [Specific, Creative Concept Title]'.** 
**The italicized Subtitle Line (using * *) is MANDATORY and must be witty/funny. Do not include square brackets `[` `]` in the subtitle output.**
**DO NOT DEVIATE FROM THIS TWO-LINE TEXT STRUCTURE FOR ANY SLIDE.**

I want to make a slide for a series where the theme is "{theme}".
Can you make a 9:16 slide or tiktok in the following style:

Retro Sci-Fi Anime Aesthetic:
These images embody a vintage, nostalgic anime style typical of the late '70s and '80s sci-fi genre, reminiscent of classic anime movies and manga such as "Akira," "Gundam," or the works of artists like Moebius.

Limited Color Palette:
They employ muted, pastel-like colors and warm earth tones (soft yellows, oranges, beige) complemented by contrasting darker outlines. This creates a distinctive retro feel and evokes an atmosphere of warmth and nostalgia.

Strong Outlines & Detailed Line Work:
The artwork uses defined, bold outlines and careful, detailed linework, capturing meticulous textures and shading, particularly noticeable in mechanical or robotic details.

Minimalistic Backgrounds & Composition:
Backgrounds are often minimalistic, focusing attention primarily on the characters, creatures, or machines featured prominently. This helps to emphasize the subjects clearly.

Cross-cultural Influences:
There's a visible influence from both Japanese manga/anime traditions and European comic aesthetics (especially Franco-Belgian comics), particularly in terms of character design, facial structures, and clothing styles.

Instructions for this specific image:
1) make sure its dnd and not futuristic
2) make sure the text specified below is centered clearly on the image

visual: {visual}

The slide should have this exact text (don't add any other text):
